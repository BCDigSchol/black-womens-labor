<p>Melnea Cass was by a large margin one of the most well-known individuals from this data set. Born in 1896, she was 24 years old and had a one-year old child in 1920. She was a housewife, not formally employed, though she had previously worked as a domestic and would later describe her work history in an interview, “Housework… I did that for years, sometimes boarding in, sometimes not. It was a good way to earn a living because you got your room and board. I did have a job at a millinery store once which I liked very much, but it just didn’t pay enough and so I went back to cleaning.” (Boston Herald, June 20 1976). </p>

<p>Melnea Cass became a prominent community organizer and advocate for the residents of Roxbury in her later years, particularly post-WWII. But her political and community engagement went back much farther than that, including organizing black women of Roxbury to vote. “We marched to the polls together because a lot of black women feared for their lives,” (Boston Herald, 1976).</p>

<p>Over several decades, Melnea was involved in various community and national organizations, from the NAACP to local mothers’ groups. She became well-known outside of Roxbury for her work during the civil rights movement, though she remained focused on improving her local community.</p>
